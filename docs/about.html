            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Georgia Tech Tribe has existed for over 30 years; the date of founding is lost to the mists of time, but proof of the team’s existence dates to 1987. Tribe has made five Nationals appearances, first in 1987 and most recently in 2012. Tribe has qualified for Regionals for at least 14 years running; records before that were destroyed in the Incident of 2004.
                <br><br>
                In 2012, Callahan winner Nick Lance and transfer Jay Clark helped lead Tribe to a 29-12 season, two tournament wins, and a bid to Nationals. 2006 and 2010 were also excellent seasons for the team, each time losing in the game to go to Nationals, in regions that included the eventual champion and at least one quarterfinalist. In 1992, before a third of the 2012 team was born, the team went 3-2 at Nationals, losing only to champion Oregon and finalist Cornell.
                <br><br>
                Since then, the program has continued to be a regional contender and developed well over a dozen future club nationals participants for Chain Lightning, Tanasi, El Diablo, Machine, Ironside, Johnny Bravo, and Bucket.
                <br><br>
                In 1998, the team was renamed “A Tribe Called Tech” (usually shortened simply to “Tribe”) in homage to “A Tribe Called Quest.”
